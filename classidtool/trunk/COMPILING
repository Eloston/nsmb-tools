Compiling


What you need:
cx_freeze for Python 3.2
Python 3.2
PyQT 4.2 or greater for Python 3.2 (GUI only)


How to compile:
(A) -> Where the binaries will output to

Text-Interface:
cxfreeze txtinterface.py --target-dir (A)

GUI:
cxfreeze guiinterface.py --target-dir (A)

This command will work on any platform

For now, you will have to create separate binaries for the different interfaces (One for GUI and one for Text-Interface)

NOTES FOR WINDOWS:

If Python 3.2 is not installed under C:\Python32, then you need to takes these steps to configure cx_freeze:

1) Go to PYTHON32PATH\Scripts, and open cxfreeze.bat in a text editor. Change the paths in the script to the directory you're currently in.

2) Add your current directory location to your PATH Environmental Variable if you want to use the command cxfreeze anywhere.
